# Debug Challenge

A very confused developer tried to print out the link to the next challenge with this go program. 
We don't know what happened, but it doesnt work.
We need you to get this program working to find the link to the next challenge. 

You can run the entire program by executing "go run main.go" in your terminal. See what happens.
